Hardware:
  arduino

Software:
  Embedded C

    try to read all the basics as much as possible

Interface:

  Android: interface which take the input from the hardware and show some sort of graph or single

  Try to search for source codes online, basically which will connect to arduino and receive some signals from the sensor.

  Remote Control Car:

    App ( Send the Signals ) -> Chip -> Hardware ( Receive Signals )

  
  Wireless Sethescope:
    
    App ( Receive Signals ) <- Chip <- Hardware ( Send the Signals )


ToDo:
  Search for online codes which can receive audio inputs and display them in the application
